    <p>
    The brain doesn't naturally value going slow. It always wants to jump from next to next to next. It wants to use you to fuel it's ego and it uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_principle_%28psychology%29">[pleasure principle]</a> to
    make you feel like you're succeeding. It *wants* you to feel good so it tricks you and as you smash through pages in quick successions. You <span class="bolden">feel</span> like you're improving. You're seeing the content change. The lessons differentiate and progress
    bar adjust but there's a physical process involved in all of this. The dendrites need to connect to make habits form.

  As my friend <a href="https://intj.com.br/"> Smace BR</a> says: You can eat and eat and eat

    As much as you can in one session. 1 chicken, 3 thick-shakes, 2 burgers a water melon, some carrots and no matter if you eat all that, you still won't get fat the next day because it takes time to digest.

<p> As an ode to learning here's a little table I made in CSS. Now I just have to <b>recall</b> it a few more days at a times ;)</p>

    <h3>vpn: (<span class="pink">picking a vpn</span>)</h3>

    <p>I've been watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTgcniqEdxI">60 Days in</a>. It's tv series where people intentionally go to jail to blend in. <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH3ezn1Como&list=PLcviVtB85dLzO89qhDSM0OOn5a5iw8Ptc"> Some people fail miserably</a>
      while others are in their element.


      Unfortunately the series is blocked in Australia. At first I looked at VPNs.

      but then I thought fuck it, I'll checkout <a href="http://www.digitalocean.com">Digitalocean</a> so I created a Ubuntu droplet starting at $5 AUD,

      read the manual and installed <a href="https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn">openvpn.</a>

    <div class="lesson">
      <span class="bolden">Lessons Learned:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>The <b><u>scp</u></b> command can copy files on a remote server to a local one.
          Example: scp root@135.132.137.194:/root/web.ovpn web.ovpn </li>

        </p>
        <li> Using Openvpn is easy! - once you have the .ovpn file generated you can just type openvpn file.ovpn or load it on your pc or phone and then go to <a href="http://ifconfig.io/">http://ifconfig.io/</a> to test it.</li>
      </ul>
